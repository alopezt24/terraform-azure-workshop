# Building Azure infrastructure using Terraform

Below is a series of "challenges" or guided exercises to help attendees learn about Terraform and how to use it to create Azure Resources. These are not meant the be "hands-on labs" or step-by-step guides. The goal is to provide a series of exercises that have an expected outcome. Some steps and code will be provided. In the end, the hands-on experience should lead to a deeper level of learning.

## Prerequisites

- Laptop
- Azure account with access to deploy at least 10 cores and permissions to generate a service principal. A trial Azure account can be created for this event.
- Github Account (Free)
- Terraform Enterprise Account. Attendees will be provided a 30-day trial.

Setting up your laptop for the challenges is done in Challenge 00 - Getting Started.

For each challenge, change your working directory to the folder for that challenge.
Each challenge is meant to be independent of each other.
